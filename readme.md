Guide to playing Conway's Game of Life:

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton simulation game developed by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, which means that its evolution is determined by its initial state and does not require any further input from the player.

The game is played on a grid of cells, where each cell can either be alive (represented by a filled square) or dead (represented by an empty square). The game follows a set of simple rules that determine the state of each cell based on its neighboring cells:

Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
All other live cells die in the next generation, and all other dead cells remain dead.
To play the game, follow these steps:

Start the game by running the program or script in your preferred programming language.
Observe the initial state of the grid, which can be randomly generated or set by the player.
Click on any cell to make it alive or dead. This can be done while the game is running or while it is paused.
Press the 'p' key to pause or unpause the game at any time.
Observe how the state of the grid evolves over time based on the rules of the game.
Continue playing the game by adding or removing cells and observing the evolution of the grid.
Some tips for playing the game:

Start with a simple initial state to observe the basic behavior of the game.
Experiment with different initial states and observe the different patterns that emerge.
Try to create stable patterns or oscillators that repeat over time.
Observe how gliders and other moving patterns travel across the grid.
Conway's Game of Life is a fascinating and addictive game that has captured the interest of mathematicians and computer scientists for decades. It is a great way to explore emergent behavior and complexity in a simple, yet powerful, simulation. Have fun playing!
